\section{Decision problem}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We study a decision problem in which the consequence $c \in \C$ of various alternative actions $a\in\mathcal{A}$ depend on the parameterization $\theta\in \Theta$ of an economic model. A consequence function $\rho: \A \times \Theta \mapsto \C$  details the consequence of action $a$ under parameters $\theta$:
%
\begin{align*}
c = \rho(a, \theta).
\end{align*}

A decision-maker ranks consequences according to a utility function $u: \C \mapsto \R$ where higher values are more desirable. The structure of the decision problem $(\A, \theta, \C, \rho, u)$ is known, but there is uncertainty about the true parameterization $\theta_0$, i.e., the consequences of a particular action remain ambiguous. However, an observed sample of data $\psi \in \Psi$ provides a signal about the true parameters as $P_{\theta}$, the sampling distribution of $\psi$, differs by $\theta$.\\

A statistical decision function $\delta: \Psi \mapsto \mathcal{A}$ is a procedure for determining an action for each possible realization of the sample. Statistical decision theory provides the framework to compare the performance of alternative decision functions  $\delta \in \Gamma$. The utility achieved by any $\delta$ is a random variable before the realization of $\psi$. Thus \citet{Wald.1950} suggests measuring the performance of $\delta$ at all possible parametrizations $\theta$ by computing the expected utility with respect to its induced sampling distribution.
%
\begin{align*}
  \E_{\theta}\left[u\left(\rho(\delta(\psi), \theta)\right)\right] = \int_\Psi u\left(\rho(\delta(\psi), \theta)\right) d P_{\theta}(\psi)
\end{align*}
%
In general, there is no single decision function that yields the highest expected utility for all possible parameterizations and so determining the best decision function  $\delta^*$ is not straightforward. However, decision theory proposes various criteria \citep{Gilboa.2009,Marinacci.2015} to aggregate performance of a decision function at all possible parameterizations. At the most fundamental level, any decision function is admissible if another function does not exist whose expected utility is always at least as high. In most cases, several decision functions are admissible, and additional optimality criteria are needed. We explore the common three criteria: (1) maximin, (2) minimax regret, and (3) subjective Bayes.\\

Following the maximin decision criteria \citep{Gilboa.1989,Wald.1950}, we determine the optimal decision function by computing the minimum expected performance for each decision function over all points in the parameter space and choosing the one with the highest minimum performance. Stated concisely,
%
\begin{align*}
\delta^*= \argmax_{\delta \in \Gamma } \min_{\theta\in \Theta} \E_{\theta}\left[u(\rho\left(\delta(\psi), \theta\right))\right].
\end{align*}

For the minimax regret criterion \citep{Manski.2004,Niehans.1948}, we compute the maximum regret for each decision function over all points in the parameter space. The regret of choosing a decision function for any realization of $\theta$ is the difference between the maximum possible performance where the true parameterization informs the decision and its actual performance. We then select the decision function with the lowest maximum regret. Thus, the minimax regret criterion solves:
%
\begin{align*}
\delta^* =  \argmin_{\delta \in \Gamma } \max_{\theta\in \Theta}  \underbrace{\left[\max_{a \in \A}  u(\rho\left(a, \theta\right))  - \E_{\theta}\left[u(\rho\left(\delta(\psi), \theta\right)) \right]\right]}_{\text{regret}}.
\end{align*}

Subjective Bayes \citep{Savage.1954} requires a subjective probability distribution $f_{\theta}$ over the parameter space. Then we select the decision function with the highest expected subjective utility:
%
\begin{align*}
\delta^* = \argmax_{\delta \in \Gamma }  \int_{\theta} \E_{\theta}\left[u(\rho\left(\delta(\psi), \theta\right))\right]df_{\theta}.
\end{align*}
